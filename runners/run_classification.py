# File to compute trust scores for classification methods



"""
For each classification method, we need to return the actual scores (e.g., trust), the accuracy drops, n_drops,
and the AUC for the rejection curve...

May need to retain accuracy drops and n_drops separately from numerical results for use in plots.
